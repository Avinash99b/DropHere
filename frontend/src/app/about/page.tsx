                    <p>
                        In a world where digital privacy is increasingly scarce, DropHere was founded on a simple principle: sharing should be private, simple, and secure. Our mission is to provide an ephemeral file and text sharing service that respects your privacy by design. We believe you shouldn't have to register for an account or navigate complex interfaces just to send a piece of information from one device to another.

                    <p>
                        We are a small team of passionate developers and privacy advocates who were frustrated with the state of file sharing. We wanted to build a tool that we would use ourselvesâ€”one that is fast, free, and doesn't hoard user data. DropHere is the result of that vision.
